## Thoughts:

This project was pretty challenging to say the least. It was pretty difficult figuring out a way for the database to hold images and to store them. I did learn a few new things - and worked with multer for the first time. So that was interesting. I might look to Cloudinary next time, or with another image storing database and see if that is any easier.
